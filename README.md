# liteQuery
This is minimum script that help to access DOM elements and events

It's useful for some times we can not use larger javascript libraries, like jQuery

I did not found any completed script for this purpose, so i decided writing it by myself. Just use for me now

Temporary called liteQuery

Base on basic javascript

Tested on chrome, firefox and IE 11
